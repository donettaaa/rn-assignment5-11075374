# DCIT 202 ASSIGNMENT 5
The assignment's primary goals are to replicate a given user interface mockup, add a light/dark theme switch and use unique components to closely resemble the design.

# Features
1. UI Design: The program resembles the given UI mockup.
2. Bottom tabs navigation: Use the bottom tabs to navigate to the home and settings screens.
3. Themes: Users have the option to alternate between light and dark themes.
4. Custom components: Applying customized components ensures an overall cohesive appearance.

# How I built the mobile application

1. I used the React Native CLI to create a new react native project. I then established a git repository and made 'rn-assignment5-11075374' the remote repository.
2. I accessed and used the UI mockup as a guide during the development process.
3. The layout was constructed using react native components, including view, text, image and others.
4. I made sure the styles and structure closely matched the design.
5. React-navigation and its dependencies were installed in order to manage app navigation.
6. I created a bottom tab navigation containing the Home and Settings tabs.
7. Toggle switch for switching between light and dark themes was added to the settings panel.
8. I created reusable, custom components to ensure functionality and design coherence.

# Submission
1. I generated a README file containing screenshots and documented the development process.
2. I compressed the repository and removed the node_modules.
3. I sent the zipped folder to Sakai as requested.
